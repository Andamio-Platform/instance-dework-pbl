In this lesson, we will be learning how to create a Cardano wallet using Nami Wallet as an example.  
If you would like to explore other wallet options or general info about Wallets check back to [overview page](/course/module/101)

#### Step 1: Go to the official Nami Website

The first step is to visit [namiwallet.io](namiwallet.io) and select your preferred browser to download the extension. We will provide a step-by-step guide using the Brave Browser for this tutorial.

Clicking on the browser icon will automatically open a new tab in the Chrome web store, where you can add the extension to your browser.

For faster access and a quick shortcut to the Nami Wallet, you can use the "pin icon" to pin the Nami Wallet extension. This way, it will be available on the Google Chrome toolbar.


#### Step 3: Create a Nami New Wallet

After clicking the Nami Wallet, you can see two options:
1. New Wallet
2. Import

#### Step 4: Store your Seed Phrase

After clicking continue, Nami will provide you with your unique Seed phrase. This Seed phrase will give you direct access to your Nami Wallet.

⚠️ Note it down in private. Never show your seed phrase to anyone. Keep your seed phrase in a safe place. You can only recover your account via your seed phrase. There is no alternative to this. If you lose your seed phrase, you cannot recover your wallet.


#### Step 5: Create your Account

> After noting down and verifying your Seed Phrase, you will be prompted to create an account. To do so, fill in the desired wallet name and password.

> After that, you can click Create.

And you're all set! You can now close this tab by clicking close.


#### Step 6: How to find your Nami Wallet Address

To find your Nami Wallet Address, open the Nami extension on your browser and click the Receive button, which will open a QR code, and your address will appear below. This is the receiving Cardano Native address of your Nami wallet.
