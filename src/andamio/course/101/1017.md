## Dework PBL Lesson:  Registering Your Cardano Wallet for Contribution Rewards

### Introduction

As a contributor to tasks in the Singularity Net Ambassador Program via Dework, it's essential to register your Cardano wallet to receive the rewards you've earned.  
This lesson will guide you through two methods of registering your wallet, ensuring your rewards get delivered to the right place.  
NB! Changing to custom avatar name in the server will require you to use Google Form Registration method

### Deciding on a Registration Method

Google Form Registration:

 - Pros: Direct and uncomplicated.
 - Cons: Uses manual data entry.

Webpage Registration with Discord Login:

 - Pros: No manual data entry
 - Cons: does not recognise the specific avatar name used in the Discord server if user has changed it

### Method 1: Google Form Registration

Steps:

-   Access the Google Form: [https://forms.gle/cxjPBEMH6AEYuLnRA](https://forms.gle/cxjPBEMH6AEYuLnRA)
