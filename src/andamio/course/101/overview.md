We share 2 different lessons for 2 different Cardano wallets and guide how to set up wallet and find your wallet addresses.

You only need one Cardano wallet.

If you would like to explore other wallet options check out this [Governance Guild Treasury Management PBL](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/governance-guild/project-based-learning/introduction/treasury-management-pbl#wallets-1)

You can skip creating wallets, however then we wonâ€™t be able to recognize your contribution nor verify your learnings, but you are still able to take part of the process.

Your contributions are recognized by rewarding your wallet address with Cardano tokens that either have financial or social value.
