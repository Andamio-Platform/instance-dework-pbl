## How to manage spaces?

When you click on the settings icon next to the name of the view, you can filter by:

- Tags (labels, actions, outputs)
- Assignees
- Priority
- Reviewer
- Discord Roles
- Skills
- Templates

You can sort by:

- Custom (drag-n-drop)
- Priority
- Due Date
- Creation Date
- Bounty

To see backlog column add a new filter and include the backlog with other Statuses.

> Go ahead and try to add a backlog to your space

More information about filters can be found in [Dework Guides](https://dework.gitbook.io/product-docs/fundamentals/task-views)
