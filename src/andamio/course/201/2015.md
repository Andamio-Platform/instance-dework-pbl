## How to create Dework Tasks templates?

This guide provides a step-by-step process on how to create and use templates in Dework. Templates can streamline your work processes, maintain consistency in your tasks, and save time when creating repetitive tasks.

# Overview

Templates in Dework are pre-defined tasks that can be used as a base when creating new tasks. They include necessary details such as the task name, tags, task points, and a description that informs the task creator/assignee of their expectations. Once a template is created, it can be accessed and used multiple times, promoting uniformity and efficiency.

Templates also come with permission settings that can be customized to your project's needs. These permissions can dictate who is automatically assigned the task, who can apply for the task, or which roles can submit work.

# Creating a Template
