## How to Manage Tasks?
### Introduction

In this Project-Based Learning (PBL) lesson, we will explore the concept of task permissions within the Dework framework. We'll delve into different methods of task assignment and submission, each catering to various project needs and contributor dynamics. There are four types of permissions that determine who will work on the task.

# Assign Someone
This method is straightforward. If you already know who will handle a specific task, you simply assign it to them directly. This approach is efficient for tasks requiring specific expertise or for recurring assignments.

# Multiple Submissions
Here, contributors are free to submit their work, and from these submissions, one or more are chosen as winners. This method encourages a competitive environment and is ideal for sourcing diverse solutions or ideas.
