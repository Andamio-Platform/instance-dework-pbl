## How to Manage Tasks?
### Introduction

This lesson focuses on the movements of tasks within Dework and covers the entire task movement process, providing a clear understanding of each phase from creation to completion.

### Columns in the Dework Bounty Board

Dework allows a systematic approach to task management that includes creating, tagging, assigning, reviewing, and rewarding tasks. Each of these stages is represented as different columns in the Dework Bounty board, namely - `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Review`, and `Done`.  
In addition you can add `Backlog` State with [Filter](course/module/201/2012) changes.

**To Do:** This is the initial phase where all newly created tasks are placed. These tasks are either awaiting pickup or assignment.  
**In Progress:** Once a task is picked up or assigned to someone, it transitions to the `In Progress` phase. Here, the task is actively being worked on.  
**Review:** After completion of the work and updating the evidence of work in the task, it is moved to the `Review` phase. Here, the workgroup lead audits the task.  
**Done:** Upon successful review and reward distribution by the Treasury Guild, tasks are moved to the `Done` phase.
