# Case Study using the Dework PBL Workgroup as an example
## Dework Task Management Board
When you open the Dework PBL Board and Scroll Done Status section to bottom we will find that early days most of the actions were recorded as [Activity Lists](/course/module/301/3011) or as Participation.  
When you scroll back up to current day (~3 month difference)  
You will find more diverse set of people doing tasks, but also far less basic [Activity Lists](/course/module/301/3011) due to finding patterns in project management.

Another thing you will notice is that over time you will have a list of Templates that could be easily used to differentiate the main recognized activities  
There are 6 different [task templates](/course/module/201/2015) that have emerged over time

## Workgroup Meetings
The large part of keeping the workgroup on track and recognised is to meet regulary and establish norms on what to do and how to distribute resources.  
After these initial discussions you will have clearer vision what to put on Dework Board.  
For the Dework PBL Workgroup we have been using Miro Board for caprturing actions and decision from meetings.  
Miro Board helps to organise meeting notes and make it easier to visualise project operations, state and resources.  
We meet bi-weekly for 90 minutes to go trough agenda items and dework tasks.  
In the meetings we decide on action items and next steps.  
Best place to catch up with Workgroup Meetings would be to read them from Miro Board. 

## Workgroup Miro Board
The Miro Board consist of multiple windows that has a colored frame around them  
![Miro Board Template Windows](/Dework_PBL_Pictures/Module_301/Miro_Board_Template_Windows.png)
Red Color is used for Workgroup Documentation. These areas may be changed often, but for mayor changes these windows are archived.  
White Color is used for archival purposes, when documentation windows have huge changes  
Yellow Color is used for meeting minutes and meeting related info collection  
Green Color has not been used in Dework PBL Workgroup

![Miro Board Overview](/Dework_PBL_Pictures/Module_301/Dework_PBL_Miro_Board_Overview.png)

When you explore the meeting window you most often will find agenda item on top left corner and meeting summaries for that in the right left corner.  
Meeting Notes are usually color coded. You will find action items and next steps in purple color and they are turned green if they are completed or answered.

## Miro Board Task Statuses
Dework has limitations on how many statuses can be used in tasks.
One of the Miro Board Windows visualizes the structure and priority of lessons we create and their statuses.
In the below Dework picture, you will find filtered lesson tasks that correspond with the Miro Board.
