## How to create bounties into Dework community?

### Steps to perform during Task Creation:

1.  After [creating a task](https://instance-dework-pbl.vercel.app/course/module/201/2017) go to the `Add Bounty` button available at the top of the task and just below the Title section

2.  It’ll show two options, one is `Fixed Budget` and the other one is `Open for Bids`, we can select either of them depending on the task requirements. Let’s select the `Fixed Budget` option for this example.

3.  (Skip this step if the Token is already Available) We’ll now need to add the desired token from the available Network options.  
After clicking the `Add Token`  
Select the desired Network (example `Polygon Mainnet`)  
Then write the Token Name (or paste the contract address), in our case we are gonna use `USDC` as an example and finally hit `Add Token`.

4.  Now select `Token`, add the Bounty Amount and click `Save`

5.  Make sure to provide all the necessary information in the task description for onboarding new contributors which could be something like:

>The USDC rewards are converted into AGIX and provided to those who have previously contributed to workgroup tasks.  
The Wallet Addresses and Discord names are publicly shared.  

>Your Cardano wallet can’t be linked to this platform.  
If you haven`t yet, Pls submit your addr1 here:
[https://forms.gle/cxjPBEMH6AEYuLnRA](https://forms.gle/cxjPBEMH6AEYuLnRA)

>Once you Apply or submit work, your Discord handle will be linked to the task. The rewards are usually processed on Tuesday by the treasury team.

6.  Finally press the `Create Task` button and our task would be live in the `Open Bounties` section of Dework Platform (dashboard picture below)  
This is located in the Dework Main Page [https://app.dework.xyz/](https://app.dework.xyz/)

#### NB! After Task Completion, remove the USDC rewards before accepting submissions to avoid conflict of unrewarded tasks
