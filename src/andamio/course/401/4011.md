We are always looking to improve our onboarding documentation and one of the ways to do it at scale is use feedback forms.
You have seen the lessons and tried them out, let us know, were our lessons helpful to you.

In this lesson we go over different questions and how to effectively provide general feedback using multiple form submissions.

## Feedback Form Questions
We ask for Discord handle to recognize your contribution and get in contact with you for further questions if needed.  
We provide a list of all available lessons and pages we have for Dework PBL.  
![Feedback Form SLT List](/Dework_PBL_Pictures/Module_401/Feedback_Form_SLT.png)

We want to know how would you rate (1-4) the quality of the selected lessons?  
You can select multiple lessons from previous list to give aggregate information about those lessons if you noticed a common theme or improvement for lessons

Then we have several question to improve our lesson oriententation, usefulness and quality.  
These measures help to find our focus areas.  

Those who have a hollistic view about the course. What you think is missing, wrong place or no longer needed?

Often we have experienced similar learnings before, lets share them with eachother, perhaps it will help us combine content and progress faster.  
Help us improve to achieve excellence with the couse material and define what should be our next things to improve.  
By the end of feedback form we will learn if we achived onboarding to Dework Application.
