We are always looking to improve our onboarding documentation and one of the ways to do it at scale is use feedback forms.  
You have seen the lessons and tried them out, let us know, were our lessons helpful to you?

In this lesson we go over different questions.

## Form Expectations
We ask for [Discord handle](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12620128861463-New-Usernames-Display-Names) to recognize your contribution and get in contact with you for further questions if needed. 

We want to know how would you rate (1-4) the quality of the course content

Then we have several question on your improvements ideas and experience  

By the end of feedback form we will learn if we achived our course objectives.
