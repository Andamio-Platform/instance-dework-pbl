We are always looking to improve our onboarding documentation and one of the ways to do it at scale is use feedback forms.  
You have seen the lessons and tried them out, let us know, were our lessons helpful to you?

In this lesson we provide insight about the form structure

## Form Expectations
We ask for [Discord handle](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12620128861463-New-Usernames-Display-Names) to recognize your contribution and get in contact with you for further questions if needed. 


The feedback form is split into sections by modules.  
Each lesson will have the same checkboxes:
- This lesson is excellent
- This lesson is good enough and requires no new updates
- This lesson is good enough but I would add few more updates
- Uncertain, needs discussion
- I know nothing
- Other

We aim to get your feedback on each lesson you see on Dework PBL development website.
Is the content provided useful enough and broken down into manageable lessons to learn about Dework used in Ambassador program or could it be improved?  
After collecting multiple answers we are able to get good sentiment on which lessons to focus on.

'I know nothing' row, can be used to share uncertantity from your perspective, if you are not able to assess the quality of lesson.  

Each lesson will also have the 'Other' row, that can be used to provide more specific information on what could be improved.
