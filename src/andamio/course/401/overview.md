# Welcome to Module 401

This module is all about giving back to the course.  
As you now had a journey trough learning Dework and insights into different ways it has been used.  
We would like for you to share with us the experience and some ideas how could we improve the course.  
Think back to issues you had, sections that were confusing or amazing as you were going trough the course.

In this module we have three types of feedback forms:
- Lesson Feedback Form - Share feedback about lessons
- Course Feedback Form - Share thoughts on the course overall or new lessons
- Sentiment Analysis Form - Rate lessons individually and provide specific feedback if applicable
